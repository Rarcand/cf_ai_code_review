# Here is a list of prompts used when developing the application

---

### PROMPTS:
1. Here is my basic HTML for the frontend. Could you provide the CSS to style it into a professional, modern-looking application? Please use a dark theme with an orange accent color, similar to Cloudflare's branding, and make the buttons and inputs look clean.

2. My frontend is getting a CORS policy: No 'Access-Control-Allow-Origin' header is present error when trying to fetch from my backend worker. It's failing on a "preflight request". Here is my index.js worker code: How do I fix the code to correctly handle the OPTIONS preflight request?

3. I finished my project. Can you make sure it fits the requirements?
